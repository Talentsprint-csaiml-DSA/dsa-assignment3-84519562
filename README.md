Create a file called **main.py** and define the required functions. Ensure the function is named as **Huffman_coding**

### Graded Exercise:

**Problem Statement:**

Write a function that encodes a given string (sentence) into a binary code using Huffman coding.

### Requirements:

The function should:
* Count the frequency of each character in the input string.
  
* Build a Huffman tree based on the character frequencies.

* Generate binary codes for each character using the tree.

* Encode the input string by replacing each character with its corresponding binary code.


### Approach:

**Input:**

input_string: A string (sentence) that needs to be encoded.

**Output:**

A string of binary code representing the Huffman encoded version of the input string.
